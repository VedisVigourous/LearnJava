        /* OOPs - Maps the code with the real world
           example : A bottle it can be used in various ways like closing it , opening it or filling
           That is just like bottle is connected to real world through our actions
           OOPs connect our code very close to our real world. */

        // OOPs shortens or makes complex code easier. " WORKS ON DRY PRINCIPLE "
        // Example : If we want a link at different pages on a website , rather than coding it on each page
        //           we use OOPs to code it once on base and use it on different sites.

        // Class - its a blueprint where you make objects (Pre designed template)
        // Objects - It is an real world entity formed from a Class (Memory is allocated after object instantiation.
        // It has all the valid information to create objects
        // Example: JEE application form (Class) Filled by student (Object making) - Application received (Object).

        /* How to model a problem in OOPs - (Follow NAV RULE)
           We identify the following : 1. Noun - Class - The Employee Name (WHO)
                                       2. Adjectives - Attributes - Salary , name , age etc (his/her specs)
                                       3. Verbs - Methods - give_salary() , increment() (ACTIONS) */

        // OOPs Terminology:- ('A'n 'E'ngineer 'I's 'P'erfect)
        /* 1.Abstraction - Hiding the inner details that is showing only essential info.
             Ex. An object we work upon , we are only bothered on how to work on it and not How it was made.
             Ex. Android web development , we use app rather than digging deep into its development.

           2.Encapsulation - Putting components together
             Ex. Device is a single entity with various parts.
             Ex. In java it means class is a capsule where all the components are put together thereby hide inner data.

           3.Inheritance - Using older things to develop something new. (DRY)
             Ex. Someone made smartphone won't develop another from scratch and will use developed technology.
             It saves time

           4.Polymorphism - One entity but many forms.
             Ex. Using smartphones to call , to take photos , to use as calculator and much more.  */
