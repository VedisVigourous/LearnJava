       i.e. using languages like HTML , CSS and javascript

       Java came out with a support for all, so that people who doesn't have frontend knowledge can also make their JavaDocs using 'javadoc'.

       In IntelliJ Idea just go to
       * Tools > Generate JavaDoc > Select Desired settings > Select a javadoc path > Checkbox - open javadoc in browser and there you go ... A personal javadoc is ready.   */

    /* Javadoc includes very basic knowledge, 1. Your constructors used - Summary
                                              2. Used Method Summary etc.

       IntelliJ Idea creates many commands which we do not have to type afterward -
       Javadoc - generates the java documentation automatically in HTML format

       To create a more immersive documentation - java provides us with TAGS - */
